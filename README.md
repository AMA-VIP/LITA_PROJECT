## Data Cleaning and preparation
1. Data importation
   - The data was importated after downloading an MS excel file 
   - The data was critically assessed, putting missing value and duplicate in vie
   - The cleaned data was copied to another sheet on MS excel
   - The data was changed to csv file, so it can easily be transported or imported to SQL for further analysis as requested on the project
  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The data was explored to answer the following question.
 1. On MS excel
 	-Perform an initial exploration of the sales data.
   -Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
   -Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region. 
   -Create any other interesting report
2. On SQL
   -retrieve the total sales for each product category. 
   -find the number of sales transactions in each region. 
   -find the highest-selling product by total sales value. 
   -calculate total revenue per product. 
   -calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
   -find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount. 
   -calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region. o identify products with no sales in the last quarter. 
3. On PowerBI
   -Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL.
   N/B: The dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.
